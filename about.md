<p>I am a front-end developer, designer and UX leader who is dedicated to using technology to improve access and create opportunities for underrepresented communities.</p>

<p>I am currently the UX and Front-end Architecture Lead at the United States Digital Service team at the Department of Veterans Affairs. I lead a multi-disciplined UX team in product development efforts, with a focus on brand consistency, and diversity and inclusion through accessibility.</p>

<p>Prior to the U.S. Digital Service, I spent several years in civic/political tech, building applications that help people reach voters and get more people involved in the political process. Campaigns and Elections Magazine named me a “2015 Rising Star”, which only fueled my flame for public service.</p>

<p>In addition to public service, I also serves as a board member for the LGBTQ Task Force and LGBTTech Institute.</p>
